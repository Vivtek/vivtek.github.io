<div class="title">--summer 2014--</div>
<div class="date">Published 2014-09-08 </div>

<p>Traditionally, our family has made use of summers to visit whichever of our two
countries we're not currently in. For twenty years, that meant a pilgrimage to
Budapest; now that we live in Budapest it means road tripping in the States. This year
was no exception&mdash;from June 14 to August 30, according to my calculations, I drove
a total of 4927 miles, mostly shuttling various family members around Indiana for
this event and that.</p>

<p>Even at half-power for the paying work, the result was <em>absolutely zero mental
capacity</em> for anything resembling coding, writing, writing about coding, coding
related to translation&mdash;a complete and utter void. I didn't even take any meaningful
notes, beyond the occasional recap of The Plan. (The Plan is a multi-threaded thing
that starts with better file handling, goes through literate exegesis of codebases
and declarative accounting structures, visits machine translation on the way, and
culminates in Hofstadterian generality at its most tenuous reaches&mdash;I want to say
it's been a constant companion in my life for many years, except that it is utterly
mutable. It's actually been a very <em>inconstant</em> companion in my life.)</p>

<p>Anyway, now I'm back in Budapest, Facebook is blocked, I have nobody to visit, no
class reunions, all known at-risk family members have already died, I have no need
or means to drive people around the countryside, and I'm over the jetlag <em>and</em>
the virus I caught in August&mdash;in short, session has resumed.</p>

<p><em>[In retrospect, session had not resumed.]</em></p>
