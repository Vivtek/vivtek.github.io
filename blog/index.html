<p>
Back in the 90's, when I was first running out of money for graduate work, I had already gradually refined my understanding of What I'm Doing to be, in the
shortest terms, "semantics." I didn't have the mental tools back then to understand what that meant in any detail&mdash;but I knew it when I saw it, and I saw it
everywhere in the work of the Fluid Analogies Research Group (FARG). So what I wanted to do in 1997, and what I attempted in 2004 in the spare time I turned out
not to have yet, and what I'm actually starting to achieve today, was to examine the several models of cognition that the Group had promulgated, and to distill
out the commonalities.
</p><p>
By "examine," of course, I meant to redevelop the key models in sequence, basing them on some common codebase. In the mid-90's, to me, that meant "Jumbo, Numbo, and Copycat."
Now it means a much longer list: Jumbo, Numbo, Copycat and Metacat, Tabletop, Letter Spirit, Phaeaco, SeqSee, Capyblanca, Ear's Mind, Madcat if I can ever find that thesis,
Musicat, and Linguoplotter, or some subset of those. (I'm not made of time.) Some of them have code available, some don't. I don't particularly care about that, as the point
isn't to port code but to comprehend and formalize the concepts they use.

<p>
The actual mechanism of the terraced scan is agnostic by design about what codelets actually do&mdash;there's no inherent restriction on the actions they can take.
You're perfectly free to use working data structures that aren't the Workspace, and at some point I'll be exploring that. It might be nice to have some other data
structure being built, a database or a document or maybe a code structure or something.
</p><p>
But as I've been actually exercising it and learning how I prefer to design codelets and the ecosystems they cooperate in, I'm starting to converge on some
best practices, or at least practices I find easiest to work with. One of them has been to group the actions taken by codelets into "fff actions" (fizzle/fail/fire actions taken
when the codelet terminates). Those started out as just a list of which units should be killed; if a spark fizzles, then the spark unit needs to be deleted.
And if a bond is dissolved, then obviously the bond unit needs to be deleted.

<div class="title"><a href="jum-sprint-done.html">Jum sprint (November 8 - January 8)</a></div>
<div class="st2">2026-01-08 </div><br>
<p>
I've decided to break off the current Jumbo sprint. I wrote a more detailed tech report on the "faux milestone" which you
can download in the <a href="/reports/tr2.html">technical reports area</a>, but I
ended up feeling some qualms about how definitive that milestone really is. Does the completion of half a system rise to
the momentous nature of a tech report? Probably not.
</p><p>
But a blog post? Sure&mdash;and I do want to explain what it is I completed, why it's interesting, and why I stopped at that point.

<p>
If you're reading this, then my new blog posting code is unstoppable and the Vivtek website is well on its way to being the informational colossus
it was always fated to be. I'm writing this introductory post in late January of 2026, but my intent is for it to migrate gradually backward as I
retroactively write a bit on recent work that still feels current enough for me to pretend to have been blogging it on the fly. I expect it to end
up roughly in last October, as it should remain the first post of the modern era.
</p><p>
This is actually about the fourth or fifth website publication code I've written, and you can still find examples of all of these eras on the site,
because I never throw anything away. Many of these pages, broken and with weeds growing through their antiquated HTML
and template fields, are essentially old washing machines on the back porch with a motor that probably still works. I'll go into a little history below the fold.
