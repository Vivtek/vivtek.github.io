I've decided to break off the current Jumbo sprint. I wrote a more detailed tech report on the "faux milestone" (I'll drop
a link here once I have the tech report download area up and running), but I
ended up feeling some qualms about how definitive that milestone really is. Does the completion of half a system rise to
the momentous nature of a tech report? Probably not.
</p><p>
But a blog post? Sure&mdash;and I do want to explain what it is I completed, why it's interesting, and why I stopped at that point.

<p>
If you're reading this, then my new blog posting code is unstoppable and the Vivtek website is well on its way to being the informational colossus
it was always fated to be. I'm writing this introductory post in late January of 2026, but my intent is for it to migrate gradually backward as I
retroactively write a bit on recent work that still feels current enough for me to pretend to have been blogging it on the fly. I expect it to end
up roughly in last October, as it should remain the first post of the modern era.
</p><p>
This is actually about the fourth or fifth website publication code I've written, and you can still find examples of all of these eras on the site,
because I never throw anything away. Many of these pages, broken and with weeds growing through their antiquated HTML
and template fields, are essentially old washing machines on the back porch with a motor that probably still works. I'll go into a little history below the fold.
