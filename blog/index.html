<p>This is what I've got so far in the modern era.</p>

<p>
If you're reading this, then my new blog posting code is unstoppable and the Vivtek website is well on its way to being the informational colossus
it was always fated to be. I'm writing it in late January of 2026, but my intent is for it to migrate gradually backward as I retroactively
write a few posts on recent work that still feels current enough for me to pretend to have been blogging it on the fly. I expect it to end
up roughly in last October, as it should remain the first post of the modern era.
</p><p>
This is actually about the fourth or fifth website publication code I've written, and you can still find examples of all of these eras on the site,
because, true cultural Appalachian that I am, I never throw anything away. Many of these pages, broken and with weeds growing through their antiquated HTML
and template fields, are essentially old washing machines on the back porch with a motor that probably still works. I'll go into a little history below the fold.
