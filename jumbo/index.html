<div class="title">Jumbo revisited</div>
<div class="date">Published 2026-01-22 </div>

<p>This project documents my implementation of Jumbo, a program originally written "mostly in 1982" by Douglas Hofstadter, who used
Lisp, an elegant weapon for a more civilised age. My real project, of course, is not to write a really abstruse way of finding anagrams
that aren't even required to be English words, but to kick off the development of (my version of) the architecture as a whole. I'm starting with Jumbo because it
has the fewest moving parts and out of a vague sense that ontogeny should recapitulate phylogeny. Because I'm Han Solo to Hofstadter's Obi Wan, I'm writing it in
Perl, the common blaster of programming languages.</p>

<p>The code is hosted at Codeberg, and you can <a href="https://codeberg.org/Vivtek/AI-FARG-Jumbo">check it out there</a>. It builds on my implementation of the parallel terraced scan, which doesn't
have its own home on this website yet; I'll drop a link here when I get that far. In the meantime, <a href="https://codeberg.org/Vivtek/AI-TerracedScan">it's also at Codeberg</a>, of course. Fairly soon it'll
be mature enough I'll feel relaxed about putting it on the CPAN, but I'm not quite there yet.</p>

<p>The Jumbo project is currently on hold at the "Jum" stage while I work out some new functionality in AI::TerracedScan for the next phase (obviously, "Bo"). I have a
tech report written about that, but I don't have a tech report download area yet, so that'll have to wait, too. I wrote a <a href="/blog/jum-sprint-done.html">blog post about it</a>, though.
And soon I'll have more of this project site fleshed out.</p>

<p>I have a page <a href="jumbo-domain.html">here</a> explaining the domain, a second page <a href="jumbo-terraced-scan.html">here</a> explaining the terraced scan as it works in Jumbo (it needs
some more work, but you can read what I've got), and a third page <a href="chunkabet.html">here</a> explaining the Chunkabet, a small database of syllable quality in English-like
words that drives the Jumbo process.</p>
